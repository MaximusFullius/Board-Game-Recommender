# Board-Game-Recommender
This is a python program I made back in 2019 for fun. The program recommends board games to the user based on user inputs. The program is a terminal with questions that the user responds to. After a certain amount of questions, the program will recommend a game. The recommendation program was entirely based on this semi humourous diagram I found.
